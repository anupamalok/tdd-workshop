# Rock Paper Scissors Kata

Rock Paper Scissors is a game involving two players making pre-defined hand gestures at each other. The gesture that each player uses is played against the other, with a winner being decided based on the rules being used.

The three gestures used in base Rock Paper Scissors are rock, paper, and scissors. The way these are scored is as such: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock. It gets a lot more complicated when you introduce new gestures, but let's keep it simple for now.
